# SQL-Project

# Project Objective: 
The main goal of the project is to design a relational database that will describe all the known features of an ecommerce site. We will try to execute this goal by using Oracle as our relational database management system(RDBMS). We are trying to make a database for an e-commerce business that shows us product details such as (item, item_id, description, inventory, etc). We will also try to capture the logistics side of it as well by gathering data on suppliers, orders, payments, etc. We want to make basic queries that return the results for ‘common questions’. We also want to make an interactive dashboard and possibly see a product’s ‘shelf life’.


# Overview/ Background:
E-commerce is a term used for any type of business, or commercial transaction, that involves the transfer of information or funds across the Internet. The specific category of E-commerce we will be focusing on is B2C ( Bussiness to Customer). The main types of E-commerce businesses that fall into this category are online businesses that sell clothing, electronics, home goods, etc.  

Online shopping is a modern trend that just seems to profusely grow. Many exceptional opportunities continue to transpire from E-commerce. However, the problem of competition can be very intense, where One seller does not want to fall short of another seller. E-commerce can be very competitive, and it can be really easy for companies to fall behind if they are not equipped with the proper resources. That’s why it is our job as “Data Scientist” (Data engineers in this case) to engineer methods/ pipelines/ dashboards that overall increase productivity to the seller.
